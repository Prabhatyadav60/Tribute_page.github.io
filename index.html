        India without its soldiers would be like God without his angels!!<br>
        Soldiers are the brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect their country and its
        citizens. They sacrifice their time, their comfort, and sometimes even their lives to defend their nation's
        freedom and ensure the safety of their fellow citizens. Their unwavering dedication to duty, their courage in
        the face of danger, and their selfless service are qualities that we should all admire and appreciate. It is
        important that we honor and pay tribute to our soldiers, both past and present, for their service and
        sacrifice..<br>

            On 16 December 1971, during the Battle of Basantar, Lieutenant Khetarpal was in command of a tank troop of
            the
            17 Poona Horse regiment. The regiment was tasked with capturing an enemy position across a canal in the
            Shakargarh sector of Punjab. Despite facing heavy enemy fire, Khetarpal and his troop managed to cross the
            canal
            and engage the enemy tanks.

            During the battle, Khetarpal's tank was hit by enemy fire, causing it to catch fire and become immobile.
            Despite
            being severely wounded, Khetarpal refused to abandon his tank and continued to engage the enemy until he was
            killed.

            His gallantry and determination inspired his fellow soldiers and contributed significantly to the success of
            the
            operation. However, his sacrifice resulted in his untimely demise at the young age of 21.</p><hr><br><br>
